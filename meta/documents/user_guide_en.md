Then, in the backend main-menu go to "CMS" → "container-linkages" and check in the "Stylesheet CeresBaseline (CeresBaseline)" section the "Template: Style" - Option and check in the "Script CeresBaseline (CeresBaseline)" section the "Script loader: After scripts loaded" - Option, save it, well done!
